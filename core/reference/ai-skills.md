# AI SKILLS & EXPERIENCE — MARK HERRING

**Not just AI-curious — operationally fluent. Building, automating, and shipping with AI across the full marketing stack.**

## Philosophy

AI isn't a tool I've bolted onto existing workflows — it's how I'm rebuilding the marketing function from the ground up. The same way I've spent my career translating technical depth into business outcomes, I'm now translating AI capability into marketing execution that's faster, sharper, and more scalable than what traditional teams can deliver.

My approach: don't wait for the perfect enterprise AI platform. Pick up the tools, learn how they actually work, build workflows that solve real problems, and iterate. The CMO who understands what AI can actually do — not just what vendors claim — will build a fundamentally different kind of marketing organization.

## AI Tools — Hands-On, In Production

### Data Enrichment, Prospecting & Account Intelligence
- **Clay:** The connective tissue of the modern outbound stack. Building multi-step enrichment workflows for account and contact-level data — firmographic layering, signal-based scoring, ICP matching. Not just importing CSVs — building enrichment chains that replace what used to require a full-time ops person.
- **OctaveHQ:** Using inside Clay for ICP analysis and fit scoring — adds a layer of AI-driven account qualification that sharpens targeting before anything goes to outbound.
- **Apollo.io:** Used extensively for prospecting and outreach — replaced ZoomInfo with Apollo for contact data, sequencing, and multi-channel outbound execution. Deep familiarity with the platform as the prospecting layer alongside Clay's enrichment.
- **HockeyStack:** Account-level and product usage intelligence — understanding which accounts are engaging, what they're doing, and how to prioritize. The modern alternative to legacy intent platforms like 6sense and Demandbase, though the broader value proposition is still evolving.

### Workflow Automation
- **N8N:** Self-hosted workflow automation replacing fragmented Zapier/HubSpot workflows. Building multi-step automations that connect CRM, enrichment, content, and outreach systems. The advantage over no-code tools: full control, no per-execution pricing, and the ability to build complex conditional logic without hitting platform walls.

### AI Assistants & LLMs
- **Claude (Anthropic):** Primary AI for strategic thinking, content creation, analysis, and building. Using Claude across its full product surface — chat for research and strategy, agentic modes for building applications and automating workflows, code generation for prototyping. Deep familiarity with prompt engineering, system prompts, and context management.
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI):** Secondary AI for research, brainstorming, and quick-turn content. Using across GPT-4 and custom GPTs for specific marketing workflows.
- **Perplexity:** Familiar with AI-powered research tools as alternatives to traditional search. Have evaluated and understand the landscape, though Claude remains the primary working tool.

### Content Creation & Personalization
- **Tofu AI:** AI-driven content personalization at scale — taking core content assets and generating persona-specific, industry-specific, and stage-specific variants without manual rework. Solves the "one whitepaper, twelve audiences" problem.
- **Descript:** AI-powered video creation and editing — text-based video editing, transcription, screen recording, and publishing. Using for marketing video content where the barrier has traditionally been production cost and time.

### Conversational Intelligence & Meeting Tools
- **Gong:** Heavy user for conversational intelligence and account understanding. Analyzing sales calls, identifying patterns in buyer objections, extracting competitive intel, and using conversation data to sharpen positioning and messaging. The bridge between what marketing thinks buyers care about and what they actually say.
- **Granola:** AI-powered meeting notes — automatic transcription and summarization that captures context without disrupting the conversation.

### Website, Chatbots & Lead Capture
- **Agent Press:** AI-powered website and chatbot platform with lead capture and analysis. Using bot interaction logs to understand what visitors are asking, where they get stuck, and what content gaps exist — turning chatbot data into marketing intelligence.

### Internal AI & Knowledge Management
- **Glean:** Built specific AI assistant workflows on top of Glean's platform — competitive brief generation, first-meeting deck prep notes, and a loss analysis agent that pulls from Slack, email, and Salesforce notes to surface why deals were lost. Using Glean not just as a search tool but as an intelligence layer for sales enablement and win/loss analysis.

### Application Building & Prototyping
- **Lovable & Framer:** "Vibe coding" platforms for quickly building small apps, assessment tools, templates, landing pages, and interactive content — without needing a full development cycle. Useful for spinning up calculators, ROI tools, and other marketing assets that would normally require engineering time.
- Actively evaluating and experimenting with new agentic frameworks, MCP servers, and AI orchestration tools as they emerge.

### Image Generation
- **Google AI image tools:** Using Google's AI image generation for marketing creative, social assets, and campaign visuals — found it more practical than alternatives like Midjourney for day-to-day marketing use cases.

## Projects Built With AI

### Mark's Interview Agent (This Project)
Built a fully functional AI agent that represents me in interview contexts. Architecture includes identity files, company-specific context, STAR-formatted answer libraries, a Python engine that assembles context and calls the Claude API, and a Next.js web interface. Demonstrates: system design thinking, prompt engineering, API integration, and the ability to ship a working product end-to-end.

### Glean AI Agents
Built three purpose-built AI assistants on top of Glean's platform:
- **Competitive brief generator** — pulls from internal knowledge to produce structured competitive analysis on demand
- **First-meeting deck prep** — assembles account context and talking points for sales before initial meetings
- **Loss analysis agent** — ingests Slack conversations, email threads, and Salesforce notes to surface patterns in why deals were lost, turning scattered signals into actionable win/loss intelligence

### Enrichment & Outbound Automation
Built multi-step Clay + OctaveHQ + N8N workflows that replaced manual marketing ops: account enrichment, ICP scoring, signal-based prioritization, and outreach sequencing — all automated end-to-end. What used to require a dedicated ops person now runs as a self-serve pipeline.

### Marketing Apps & Interactive Content (Lovable & Framer)
Used Lovable and Framer to vibe-code small marketing apps — assessments, interactive templates, ROI calculators, and example tools — that would normally require engineering time and a sprint cycle. Spinning up functional marketing assets in hours instead of weeks.

### AI Chatbot & Visitor Intelligence (Agent Press)
Set up AI-powered website chatbot with lead capture, then built analysis workflows around the bot interaction logs — understanding what visitors ask, where they get stuck, and what content gaps exist. Turning chatbot data into marketing intelligence rather than just a support channel.

### GTM Analysis & Strategy
Using AI to accelerate competitive analysis, market sizing, positioning development, and campaign planning. What used to take a team a week now takes a morning — with better depth and fewer blind spots.

## AI and Content Creation — A Clear-Eyed View

AI cannot write marketing content that people search for. It can regurgitate — it's excellent at synthesis, summarization, and reformatting — but it cannot create thought leadership. Thought leadership requires original insight from subject matter experts with real experience and real opinions.

**What AI is good for in content:** Building outlines and structures. Cleaning up formatting and flow. Taking a master document and creating derivative versions — blog posts, social snippets, email sequences, persona-specific variants. The "last mile" of content production where the thinking is done and the execution needs to scale.

**What AI is bad for in content:** Generating the ideas themselves. Writing the original piece that has a point of view worth reading. Creating anything that will rank for competitive search terms — because Google can spot AI-generated content and so can readers. If your content strategy is "let AI write it," you don't have a content strategy. You have a noise machine.

**The right model:** Subject matter experts provide the insight. AI helps structure, expand, clean up, and repurpose. The human brings the "why should anyone care" — the AI handles the "now make it a whitepaper, a blog post, three emails, and a LinkedIn series."

This is why I rejected Jasper after a 3-month trial. Jasper is built around the premise that AI should generate content end-to-end. I found it produced competent-sounding text that said nothing worth reading. For repurposing and variant generation, tools like Tofu AI are more honest about what they're actually doing — taking human-created content and scaling it, rather than pretending AI can replace the thinking.

## Strategic Perspective — AI in Marketing

### What Most Companies Get Wrong
They treat AI as a content shortcut — "generate more blog posts faster." That's the lowest-value use case. The real leverage is in:

1. **Intelligence and enrichment:** AI that makes your targeting smarter, your ICP sharper, your signals clearer — before you ever write a word of copy.
2. **Workflow automation:** Replacing the manual connective tissue between systems — the data entry, the list building, the report assembly — that eats 40% of a marketing team's time.
3. **Personalization at scale:** Taking one strong piece of positioning and generating dozens of contextually relevant variants — by persona, industry, stage, and channel — without a content team of twenty.
4. **Analysis and decision speed:** Using AI to compress the research-to-insight cycle so you're making better decisions faster, not just producing more output.

### Where This Is Heading
The marketing org of 2027 looks fundamentally different. Smaller, more senior teams operating AI-powered systems that handle the volume work. The CMO's job shifts from managing a content factory to architecting intelligence systems — and the ones who've been building with these tools (not just reading about them) will have an enormous advantage.

### My Edge
I'm not theorizing about this — I'm operating it. Every tool listed above is something I use regularly, not something I saw in a demo. The interview agent you might be talking to right now? I built it. The enrichment workflows feeding my prospecting? I built those too. This isn't a bullet point on a resume — it's how I work.

## Tools Evaluated & Rejected (With Opinions)

Not every tool makes the cut. Knowing what I tried and why I moved on is as important as knowing what I use.

- **Jasper:** 3-month trial. Rejected. Built around AI-generated content end-to-end, which produces competent noise, not thought leadership. Prefer Claude/ChatGPT for outlines and structure, Tofu AI for repurposing — tools that are honest about what AI should and shouldn't do in content.
- **Make.com (formerly Integromat):** Replaced with N8N. N8N is more powerful, self-hosted, no per-execution pricing, and handles complex conditional logic without hitting platform walls.
- **Gumloop:** Evaluated as a workflow automation alternative. Settled on N8N instead — more control, better suited to the types of multi-step automations I build.
- **ZoomInfo:** Replaced with Apollo.io. Apollo delivers comparable contact data and prospecting at a fraction of the cost, with better outreach sequencing built in.
- **6sense / Demandbase:** Familiar with both. Find them old-school — the legacy approach to intent and ABM. Prefer HockeyStack for account-level intelligence — more modern, more product-usage aware, better suited to how buying actually happens now.

## How This Connects to My Career

This AI fluency isn't a side interest — it's the natural evolution of my entire career arc:

- **Started as a programmer** with a mathematics degree → comfortable with technical tools and systems thinking
- **Decades marketing technical products** (databases, middleware, IoT, MLOps, security) → deep understanding of what technical buyers actually need
- **Always hands-on** — wrote copy, built campaigns, debugged funnels → now building AI workflows with the same intensity
- **Pattern of early adoption** — Java ecosystem at Sun, open-source at Hortonworks, time-series at InfluxData, MQTT at HiveMQ → AI-native marketing is the next wave, and I'm already in it
