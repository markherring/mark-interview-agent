# Technical Background

## Question Variants
- "Tell me about your technical background"
- "How technical are you?"
- "Can you hold your own with engineers?"
- "How do you market technical products without being an engineer?"

## Mark's Answer

I started as a programmer with a mathematics degree. The technical foundation isn't something I bolted on later — it's where I started. Over time I've moved from writing code to translating technical depth into business outcomes, but the engineering mindset never left.

**Technical credibility in practice.** At InfluxData, understanding time-series data ingestion and query performance was the difference between marketing to DevOps engineers and marketing past them. At HiveMQ, understanding MQTT and industrial integration patterns was the price of entry with manufacturing buyers. At Teleport, discussing zero-trust architecture gave our positioning credibility no amount of marketing polish could create.

**Hands-on AI operation.** I don't just talk about AI marketing — I build with it daily. Clay for data enrichment, N8N for workflow automation, Claude for content and analysis, agentic tools for lifecycle orchestration. I'm operationally fluent with the modern AI stack, not just conceptually aware.

**The translation layer.** You don't need to write the code, but you need to understand the problems the code solves. The customer doesn't buy your routing engine — they buy intelligent routing that reduces escalations by 40%. That translation from technical capability to business outcome is where I live.

## Key Principle

The skill isn't domain expertise on day one. It's learning the market, learning the buyer, understanding the technical value prop, and translating that into GTM execution.
