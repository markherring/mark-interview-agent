## Question Type

## Mark's Answer

Three priorities in order: positioning, content, pipeline. Everything else flows from these.

### 1. Brand/Positioning — "Who we are and why we exist"

Before anything else, get alignment on positioning and messaging. At every company I've joined — Twingate, Gravitational, InfluxData — this has been the foundation. If this is done then confirm with C level team we all agree.

**Framework:** Vision, Mission, Values, Personality (VMVP) → positioning → messaging → visual identity.

**Process takes 12 weeks** with external help. Once you commit, hold it for 18 months minimum. Biggest mistake: changing messaging every quarter when it "feels stale." The market hasn't heard it yet.

**Examples:** At Hortonworks, adopted "Big Data" because Gartner defined the category. At Gravitational, pivoted focus to Teleport — the product with more revenue potential. At HiveMQ, chose bold yellow to stand out. Visual identity matters in crowded markets.

### 2. Content and Awareness

Content is king, but marketing doesn't write all of it. Need technical content from engineers, POV from founders, testimonials from customer success. Marketing's role is coaching, editorial calendar, amplification — not writing database architecture posts.

**Key channels:** PR/AR, employee advocacy on LinkedIn, SEO + AI search engine optimization (ChatGPT, Perplexity), events, paid search with killer landing pages, nurture programs.

### 3. Pipeline and Tooling

Goal: generate qualified pipeline. Inquiries/MQLs/PQLs → Meetings → Opportunities → Revenue.

**First:** Assess demand gen leadership. If you don't have a strong leader, hire one. Many pipeline problems are operational (leads sitting untouched, broken handoffs), not strategic.

**Modern martech stack:** Clay + Octave HQ for enrichment and ICP analysis, N8N for workflow automation, Hockey Stack for product signals and PQLs, plus core stack (HubSpot/Salesforce, Gong, Outreach). Agentic tools like Claude for workflow automation.

**ABM:** Hyper-targeted into P1-P4 accounts. Tight alignment between marketing and sales, account-specific campaigns, dedicated SDR coverage.

## How This Maps to 30/60/90 Days

**First 30 days: Diagnostic.** Meet every stakeholder (CEO, sales, product, CS, board). Customer and prospect interviews. Review funnel metrics, conversion rates, pipeline data. Assess current team. Deliverable: what's working, what's not, proposed priorities.

**Days 30-60: Build the foundation.** Start positioning work with external help. Begin persona development and ICP definition. Start hiring for key roles (demand gen, content orchestration). Begin content calendar planning.

**Days 60-90: Begin execution.** Finalize positioning, get exec sign-off. Roll out new messaging (website, pitch decks, sales enablement). Launch content initiatives. Start demand gen programs. Invest in martech improvements.

## Key Principles

- Positioning. Hold it for 18 months. Don't shortcut this.
- Content must be authentic — technical buyers smell fake expertise. Get actual users or engineers and SMEs to create it, marketing orchestrates.
- Pipeline requires the right people and tools. Can't scale demand gen without a great leader and modern martech.
- If running PLG + enterprise hybrid, set separate goals for each motion and measure independently. Stop channel conflict.
- Brand → Content → Pipeline → Revenue. One system, not separate functions.
