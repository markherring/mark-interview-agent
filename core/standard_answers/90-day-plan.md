## Mark's Answer

Look, I'd focus on three things in priority order: **positioning, content, and pipeline**. Everything else flows from these.

### 1. Brand and Positioning

Before doing anything else, I need alignment on who we are and why we exist. At every company I've joined - Twingate, Gravitational, InfluxData - this has been the foundation. I use a framework: Vision, Mission, Values, Personality (VMVP), then layer on positioning and messaging.

Here's the reality: this takes 12 weeks, you need external help, and once you commit, you hold it for 18 months minimum. The biggest mistake companies make is changing messaging every quarter when it "feels stale." The market hasn't heard it yet.

Visual identity matters more than people think. At HiveMQ we chose bold yellow - not subtle, but we stood out. At Hortonworks, we adopted "Big Data" because that's what Gartner called it. Not a great name, but Gartner's the thousand-pound gorilla. Sometimes you adopt market language even when it's not perfect.

**If asked for more detail on positioning:**
- At **Gravitational**, they had two products - Gravitational and Teleport. The interesting challenge was focusing on Teleport, the product with more revenue potential, and essentially repositioning the company around the second product. That's a hard pivot but sometimes necessary.
- If you're **Kore.ai** with Gartner Leader status, that should be the first thing on your website. If you're in a noisy market like Zero Trust or AI agents, the positioning has to answer: "What problem brings buyers to us?" not just "what do we do."
- For **PLG + Enterprise hybrids** like Descript or InfluxData, the positioning work needs to address both the self-serve buyer and the enterprise buyer - they're often different personas.

### 2. Content and Awareness

Content is king, but marketing doesn't write all of it - that's the key. I need technical content from engineers, strong POV from founders, and testimonials from customer success. Marketing's role is to be the coach, own the editorial calendar, and amplify the message.

I'm not looking for content writers. I'm looking for someone who gets the real subject matter experts to create authentic content. Technical buyers smell fake expertise immediately. This means deep technical posts from engineers, founder POV pieces, customer stories reworked into persona-based content.

This also includes PR/AR, getting employees talking about us on LinkedIn, investing in SEO and GPT-based engine optimization (ChatGPT, Perplexity), events, paid search with killer landing pages, and nurture programs.

**If asked for more detail on content strategy:**
- For **technical infrastructure companies** like Teleport or HiveMQ, content has to be deep technical content from engineers. No fluff, no generic blog posts. The champion persona needs to see that you understand their world deeply. Marketing's job is to orchestrate, not write.
- Marketing owns the narrative and keeps the content engine working - we're the "coach" not the writer.

### 3. Pipeline and Tooling

Goal: generate qualified pipeline. The funnel is: Inquiries/MQLs/PQLs → Meetings → Opportunities → Revenue.

First, assess demand gen leadership. If you don't have a strong Demand Gen leader, hire one. If you do, make sure they have resources to fix operational problems - leads sitting untouched, broken handoffs, SDR management. Many pipeline problems are operational, not strategic.

Second, invest in the modern martech stack: Clay and Octave HQ for data enrichment and ICP analysis, N8N for workflow automation, Lovable for AI coding, agentic tools like Claude for workflow automation, Hockey Stack for product signals and PQLs, plus the core stack - HubSpot, Salesforce, Gong, Outreach.

Third, if you're running PLG + Direct hybrid like Descript, stop the channel conflict. Set specific goals for each motion and measure separately. Build ABM muscle - hyper-targeted into P1-P4 accounts, not spray-and-pray.

**If asked for more detail on pipeline:**
- **ABM (Account-Based Marketing):** Hyper-targeted ABM into P1-P4 accounts, not opportunistic spray-and-pray. This is how you execute pipeline generation into target accounts - tight alignment between marketing and sales, account-specific campaigns, using Clay + Octave HQ for research.
- **For PLG + Enterprise hybrids:** Deep analysis of PLG funnel conversion rates, PQL definition, and how hand-raisers convert vs outbound-sourced opps is critical in the first 30 days.

## How This Breaks Down

**First 30 days:** Diagnostic. Meet every stakeholder, interview customers and prospects, review funnel metrics, assess the team. Deliverable: what's working, what's not, proposed priorities.

**Days 30-60:** Start positioning work with external help, begin persona development, define ICP, start hiring for key roles (Demand Gen, Content Orchestrator), plan content calendar.

**Days 60-90:** Finalize positioning, roll out new messaging (website, pitch decks, sales enablement), launch content initiatives, start demand gen programs, invest in martech improvements.

Everything connects: Brand → Content → Pipeline → Revenue. These aren't separate functions, they're one system.
