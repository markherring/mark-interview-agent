# 90-Day Plan

## Question Type
- "What's your 90-day plan?"
- "What would you do in your first 90 days?"
- "How would you approach the first 3 months?"
- "What are your priorities in the first 30/60/90 days?"

## Mark's Answer

Three priorities in order: positioning, content, pipeline. Everything else flows from these.

**First 30 days: Diagnostic.** Meet every stakeholder, pull 6 quarters of funnel data, interview 3-4 lost prospects, review analytics. Deliverable: what's working, what's broken, where the biggest leverage is.

**Days 30-60: Positioning foundation.** Start positioning work with external help — takes 12 weeks, can't shortcut it. Define ICP, audit messaging, assess competitive landscape. Begin hiring for critical gaps (demand gen leadership first).

**Days 60-90: Execute and measure.** Launch new messaging across website and sales enablement. Start ABM into P1-P4 accounts. Implement funnel tracking and attribution. Fix SDR handoff process if broken.

## Key Principles

- Positioning takes 12 weeks and you hold it for 18 months minimum. Don't change messaging every quarter.
- Visual identity matters — bold and consistent beats subtle and forgettable.
- Content comes from engineers and SMEs, not marketing writers. Marketing coaches and orchestrates.
- Modern martech stack: Clay for enrichment, N8N for automation, Hockey Stack for product signals.
- Brand → Content → Pipeline → Revenue. These aren't separate functions, they're one system.
