# GTM & Pipeline Diagnostic Methodology

## Question Type
- "How do you diagnose pipeline problems?"
- "Walk me through your diagnostic approach"
- "How would you assess our marketing/GTM?"
- "What would you look at in your first 30 days?"

## Mark's Answer

Three things I look at when diagnosing pipeline or GTM problems:

**1. Funnel conversion analysis — where does it break?** Map every stage against benchmarks. At one company, 46,800 inquiries generated only 250 SQLs — a 0.5% conversion rate vs 4% benchmark. Not a volume problem, a qualification problem.

**2. Signal quality vs activity metrics — busy or effective?** Teams compensate for weak signal with more effort. At another company, sales cycles went from 60 to 100 days and win rates dropped from 40% to 15%. That's signal quality, not sales execution.

**3. Strategic clarity — does leadership agree on the basics?** If I get three different ICP answers from CEO, CMO, and VP Sales — that's the root cause, not the funnel mechanics.

## Diagnostic Process

- **Week 1:** Pull 6 quarters of funnel data, interview stakeholders (CEO, CMO, VP Sales, 2-3 AEs), review analytics, identify blind spots.
- **Week 2:** Benchmark every conversion rate, map 6-quarter trends, synthesize data with stakeholder quotes.
- **Deliverable:** What's working, what's not, what leadership must decide, 5-7 actionable recommendations.

## Key Benchmarks
- Website → Inquiry: 10%+
- Inquiry → MQL: 15%+
- MQL → SQL: 25-30%
- SQL → Opportunity: 50%+
- Opportunity → Close: 20-30%
