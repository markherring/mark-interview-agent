# GTM & Pipeline Diagnostic Methodology

## Question Type
- "How do you diagnose pipeline problems?"
- "Walk me through your diagnostic approach"
- "How would you assess our marketing/GTM?"
- "What would you look at in your first 30 days?"
- "How do you identify root causes vs symptoms?"

## Mark's Answer

**Here are the three things I look at when diagnosing pipeline or GTM problems:**

### 1. Funnel Conversion Analysis - Where Does It Break?

I start by mapping the full funnel and comparing conversion rates at every stage to industry benchmarks. The pattern tells you where the problem actually is.

**The stages I measure:**
- Website traffic → Inquiry (should be 10%+)
- Inquiry → MQL (should be 15%+)
- MQL → SQL (should be 25-30%)
- SQL → Opportunity (should be 50%+)
- Opportunity → Close (should be 20-30%+ depending on sales cycle)

At one company, everyone said "we need more pipeline." But when I looked at the data, they had 46,800 inquiries generating only 250 SQLs - a 0.5% conversion rate. At benchmark rates, that same inquiry volume should have generated 1,900 SQLs. They didn't have a volume problem. They had a qualification problem.

**The compounding effect matters.** If you're 25% below benchmark at website conversion, 48% below at inquiry-to-MQL, and 75% below at MQL-to-SQL, you don't have three small problems. You have one systemic problem that's cascading downstream.

### 2. Signal Quality vs Activity Metrics - Busy or Effective?

Teams compensate for weak signal with increased effort. More paid spend, more SDR meetings, more AE time on qualification. Everyone's busy, but outcomes are declining. That's the pattern I look for.

**Key questions:**
- Is organic traffic growing or declining? (Paid can mask organic problems)
- Are SDRs measured on meeting volume or meeting-to-SQL conversion?
- Are AEs doing early-stage qualification work that should be SDR work?
- What's the trend on sales cycle length and win rates?

At another company, sales cycles went from 60 days to 100 days (+67%) and win rates dropped from 40% to 15%. That's not a sales execution problem - that's a signal quality problem. Bad opportunities take longer to die, and they die more often.

**The diagnostic question:** "Are we working harder or working smarter?" If effort is up but outcomes are flat or down, you have a signal problem.

### 3. Strategic Clarity - Does Leadership Agree on the Basics?

Most pipeline problems aren't tactical - they're strategic. Teams execute against different definitions of success because leadership never aligned.

**The questions I ask in stakeholder interviews:**
- Who is our ICP? (If I get 3 different answers from CEO, CMO, VP Sales - that's the problem)
- What qualifies as an MQL? An SQL? (Loose definitions cascade into bad pipeline)
- What's our TOFU? (Website only? Or website + GitHub + community + social?)
- What role does PLG play? (Lead source? Qualification? Stand-alone growth?)
- What does "good pipeline" look like? (ICP fit, budget confirmed, champion + economic buyer)

At one company, the CMO said "community and open source are our primary demand drivers." But they measured nothing beyond website traffic. Zero visibility into GitHub stars, community usage, or social signals. You can't optimize what you don't measure.

**The pattern:** When I hear "we don't know who the customer is" or "I don't know why we have this" from leadership, that's not a tactics problem. That's a strategy gap.

## My Diagnostic Process

**Week 1: Data + Stakeholder Interviews**
- Pull 6 quarters of funnel data from CRM
- Interview CEO, CMO, VP Sales, Sales Ops, SDR Manager, 2-3 AEs
- Review website analytics, paid spend trends, content performance
- Look for blind spots (what aren't they measuring?)

**Week 2: Analysis + Synthesis**
- Benchmark every conversion rate against industry standards
- Identify trend lines (6-quarter view, not point-in-time)
- Map stakeholder quotes to data patterns
- Build the "what's working / what's not working" synthesis

**Deliverable Structure:**
- Executive summary: diagnosis in 2-3 paragraphs
- What we found (data-backed)
- What's NOT the problem (avoids wasted effort)
- What leadership must decide (strategic alignment questions)
- Path forward (5-7 actionable recommendations with metrics)

## Key Principles

**Root cause, not symptoms.** "We need more pipeline" is a symptom. Root cause might be: ICP is undefined, MQL criteria are too loose, PLG strategy is unclear, or sales is spending time on early qualification.

**Benchmarks matter.** Saying "7% MQL-to-SQL conversion" means nothing without context. Saying "7% vs 27% industry standard" tells you there's a 75% gap to close.

**Stakeholder quotes validate data.** When the VP Sales says "we don't know who the customer is" and the data shows 7% MQL-to-SQL conversion and 15% win rates - those aren't two problems, they're one problem showing up in two places.

**Strategy before tactics.** You can't optimize execution if leadership isn't aligned on ICP, MQL definitions, PLG strategy, or what "good pipeline" means. Fix strategy first, then optimize tactics.

**Compounding effects are leverage.** Small improvements at multiple stages compound. Going from 7.5% to 10% website conversion, 7.8% to 15% inquiry-to-MQL, and 6.8% to 27% MQL-to-SQL doesn't just add up - it multiplies. That's a 7.6× improvement in SQL output from the same inquiry volume.
