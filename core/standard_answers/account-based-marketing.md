## Mark's Answer

ABM isn't a program you bolt on — it's a way of operating. Starts with knowing your customer, focusing resources, and being willing to say no to accounts that don't fit.

**1. Start with data, not assumptions.** At HiveMQ, I analyzed where revenue actually came from — 80% was four verticals: manufacturing, automotive, energy, logistics. That insight became the entire ABM strategy.

**2. Tier accounts and commit.** P1 through P4 — P1 gets the most resources, P4 gets programmatic coverage. Hard conversations happen here. Some reps push back. Show the data, be direct about where you're placing bets, revisit quarterly.

**3. Vertical-specific content and campaigns.** Generic content doesn't work in ABM. Separate playbooks for each priority vertical — tailored language, pain points, proof points.

**4. Dedicated SDR coverage.** ABM without dedicated SDRs is just content marketing with a target list. At HiveMQ, dedicated SDR coverage drove 50%+ outbound pipeline growth.

**5. New account vs expansion — separate motions.** Different messaging, different playbooks. Expansion often has more revenue potential than people realize.
