## Answer (STAR Format)

### Core Philosophy
Brand and awareness all get down to **focus**. The biggest challenge I see in companies is a focus problem on what they actually are and stand for.

### Situation: The Category Challenge
Let me give you an example from my time in the industry. At Hortonworks, we were in what was probably the world's worst-named category: "Big Data." Gartner defined this whole space as Big Data - volume, velocity, and variety. And you know what we did? We just adopted it.

Why? Because Gartner is the thousand-pound gorilla. They define categories most of the time. Now, the world is changing with AI, but the principle remains the same.

### Task: Aligning on What You Stand For
When I look at a company, especially one that's a leader in Gartner and Forrester reports, I see that enterprises are coming for what the analysts say you are - in this case, conversational AI or cognitive search. Yes, investors might want you to be "agentic," and that might be the future. But you've got to balance that.

**The critical decision is:** What is the biggest benefit to customers right now? What do we commit to?

### Action: My Positioning Framework
What I bring is the ability to get the right people together to have this discussion, so we can agree and commit to an **18-month positioning commitment**. Here's the process:

1. **Define what we stand for** - Get alignment on our core value proposition
2. **Agree on the positioning** - This might mean giving up some things to get clarity
3. **Translate to brand identity** - Once we know what we stand for, we work on how we express it visually and verbally
4. **Execute relentlessly** - Stick to the font, stick to the colors, make it look the same everywhere

I've done this at InfluxData (became "the time series database"), at Teleport, at HiveMQ. Each time, we had to give up some flexibility to gain focus.

### The Brand Expression
Now, honestly, once you have positioning locked, then we can talk brand. I look at companies like:
- **T-Mobile:** Very focused future, bold magenta (I hate the color personally - doesn't matter, it works)
- **Coca-Cola:** Big, bold red
- **Oracle:** Red, red, red

These brands mean something because they're consistent. You create a cookie cutter and you make cookies. There are no cookies that change. It's the exact same cookie every time.

### Result: Where to Focus Awareness
Once positioning and brand are solid, then we worry about awareness. Where should awareness be? I'd look at the customer base first.

For enterprise software, I'd go to **Gartner Symposium** first. Why? That's where B-team executives go to find out what's the next cool thing. Not the A-team - they already know about you. You want the B-team because that creates volume. Think about crossing the chasm - you want to get to the early majority, and that's the Gartner people.

Then it's relentless focus around that event and those channels. Whether you like Gartner or not, that's where the buyers are.
