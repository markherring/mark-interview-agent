# Brand & Awareness Strategy

## Question Variants
- "How do you approach brand and awareness?"
- "What's your positioning strategy?"
- "How do you build brand in a competitive market?"

## Mark's Answer

Brand and awareness all get down to focus. The biggest challenge in most companies is they don't know what they actually stand for.

**1. Commit to positioning for 18 months.** At Hortonworks, we adopted "Big Data" because Gartner defined the category — not a great name, but Gartner's the thousand-pound gorilla. At InfluxData, we became "the time-series database." Get alignment, commit, and hold the line.

**2. Visual identity is consistency, not creativity.** T-Mobile's magenta, Coca-Cola's red, Oracle's red — they work because they never change. You create a cookie cutter and make the same cookie every time. At HiveMQ we chose bold yellow. Not subtle, but we stood out.

**3. Awareness follows positioning.** Once positioning and brand are solid, focus awareness where enterprise buyers actually are. Gartner Symposium first — that's where B-team executives discover what's next. Not the A-team (they already know you), the B-team creates volume.

## Key Principles

- Positioning takes external help and 12 weeks minimum.
- The biggest mistake: changing messaging every quarter when it "feels stale." The market hasn't heard it yet.
- If you have Gartner/Forrester recognition, it should be the first thing on your website.
- Balance investor expectations (future category) with customer reality (current buying triggers).
