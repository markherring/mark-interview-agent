## Mark's Answer

**I've spent 30+ years building and scaling GTM engines for technical infrastructure companies - databases, IoT platforms, developer tools, security infrastructure. The pattern has been consistent: take deeply technical products with strong adoption and turn that into scalable, forecastable revenue across PLG and enterprise.**

### Recent Highlights

**HiveMQ (CMO, 3 years)** - Enterprise MQTT platform for industrial IoT and real-time operations. Doubled qualified pipeline from $25M to $53M, scaled PLG revenue from $2.6M to $8.4M, and increased marketing's contribution to closed-won revenue from 23% to 31%. Built the hybrid PLG + enterprise GTM motion from scratch.

**InfluxData (CMO, 3.5 years)** - Time-series database for IoT and observability. This was the big build - grew ARR from $1M to $30M across Series B through D. Built the entire modern GTM engine: demand gen, SDR, product marketing, DevRel, content, events, ops. Scaled pipeline from $5.5M to $9M per quarter and launched InfluxDB Cloud, driving $5M PLG ARR with 400% DAU growth.

**Teleport (CMO, 1 year)** - Secure infrastructure access for engineers. Delivered five consecutive quarters of pipeline growth, scaling from $3.1M to $8.4M per quarter. Built the SDR team from zero to five and drove sustained multi-quarter increases in inquiries (2,282 → 8,081) and demos (135 → 300+). Achieved Gartner Cool Vendor recognition.

**Earlier:** Before these CMO roles, I spent 11 years at Sun Microsystems running Java marketing, where we grew software revenue 21% YoY to over $1B and built java.net to 1M developers in year one. Before that, Oracle, Forte Software (grew from $20M to $120M revenue), and Software AG (grew integration business 19% on a $300M+ base).

### The Pattern

**The companies vary** - databases, IoT, security, developer platforms - **but the work is the same:**
1. Take a technical product with strong adoption but weak GTM
2. Build the demand engine from scratch or rebuild it (demand gen, SDR, ops, content)
3. Define ICP and positioning clearly
4. Scale pipeline and revenue with discipline (coverage ratios, forecasting rigor, attribution)
5. Build hybrid PLG + enterprise motions where appropriate

At InfluxData, it was "we have millions of developers using the OSS, how do we turn that into enterprise revenue?" At HiveMQ, it was "we have strong industrial customers, how do we add PLG as a growth engine?" At Teleport, it was "we have product-market fit, how do we build repeatable pipeline generation?"

**What I don't do:** I don't do consumer marketing, brand marketing disconnected from revenue, or political/budgeted marketing orgs. I build revenue engines. I'm hands-on, metrics-driven, and comfortable going from $1M to $30M or doubling pipeline in 12 months. I thrive in the build phase, not the maintain phase.

### Technical Fluency

I'm technically fluent enough to understand what the product does, who it's for, and why it matters - without being an engineer. At InfluxData, I learned time-series databases. At HiveMQ, I learned MQTT and industrial IoT protocols. At Teleport, I learned Zero Trust and infrastructure access. At Sun, I lived in the Java ecosystem for 11 years.

**The skill isn't domain expertise on day one.** It's learning the market, learning the buyer, understanding the technical value prop, and translating that into GTM execution that drives pipeline and revenue.
