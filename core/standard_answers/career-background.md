## Mark's Answer

I've been building and scaling GTM engines for technical infrastructure companies — databases, IoT platforms, developer tools, security infrastructure. The pattern: take deeply technical products with strong adoption and turn that into scalable, forecastable revenue.

**HiveMQ (CMO, 3 years).** Enterprise MQTT for industrial IoT. Doubled qualified pipeline from $25M to $53M, scaled PLG revenue from $2.6M to $8.4M.

**InfluxData (CMO, 3.5 years).** Time-series database for IoT and observability. Grew ARR from $1M to $30M, built the entire GTM engine from scratch, scaled pipeline from $5.5M to $9M/quarter.

**Teleport (CMO, 1 year).** Zero Trust infrastructure access. Five straight quarters of pipeline growth, $3.1M to $8.4M/quarter, built SDR team from zero.

**Earlier foundation:** Sun Microsystems (11 years, Java platform marketing, $1B+ software revenue), Oracle, Forte Software ($20M to $120M revenue).

## Key Metrics

- Pipeline: HiveMQ $25M→$53M, Teleport $3.1M→$8.4M/quarter, Twingate $232k→$1.8M/quarter
- PLG: HiveMQ Grew 400%, InfluxData grew PLG to be 15% of all revenue
- ARR: InfluxData $1M→$30M, HiveMQ $10M-$33M, Forte $20M→$120M
- Teams: Built marketing orgs from 3 to 30-person teams, SDR teams from 0-20
