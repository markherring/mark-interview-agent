## Answer (STAR Format)

### Situation
AI is transforming marketing, but most leaders are still in "pilot mode" — running experiments, attending webinars, maybe using ChatGPT for blog drafts. Meanwhile, the real leverage is in enrichment, automation, personalization, and decision speed — not just content generation.

### Task
I decided to stop experimenting and start operating. My goal was to rebuild my marketing workflows around AI — not as a nice-to-have, but as the core operating layer.

### Action
**Built a production AI stack across the full GTM lifecycle.** Clay, OctaveHQ, and Apollo.io for data enrichment, ICP scoring, and outbound workflows. N8N for self-hosted workflow automation connecting CRM, enrichment, and outreach systems. Claude and ChatGPT for content, analysis, and strategic thinking. Tofu AI for persona-specific content personalization at scale. Gong for conversational intelligence and account understanding. HockeyStack for account-level engagement intelligence. Descript for AI-powered video. Agent Press for AI chatbots and lead capture analytics. Lovable for rapidly building interactive marketing assets without engineering cycles.

**Shipped real projects.** Built an AI-powered interview agent from scratch — Python backend, Claude API integration, Next.js frontend, context-management system. Not a toy — a working product that demonstrates system design, prompt engineering, and end-to-end execution. Built marketing automation workflows that replaced manual ops processes with AI-powered enrichment, scoring, and outreach chains.

**Replaced headcount with automation.** Lead enrichment that used to require a dedicated ops person now runs through Clay + OctaveHQ + N8N chains. Content personalization that required a team of writers now runs through Tofu. Research and analysis that took a week compresses to a morning. Interactive marketing tools that would have required engineering time get built in Lovable in hours.

### Result
I'm not preparing to use AI — I'm already operating with it daily. Every tool I mention is something I use in production, not something I saw in a demo. The interview agent you might be interacting with right now? I built it. This isn't a resume bullet — it's how I work.

## Key Takeaways for Interviewer
- Operationally fluent across 15+ AI tools spanning the full marketing stack — enrichment, automation, content, video, conversational intelligence, account intelligence, and application building
- Builds with AI, not just uses it — shipped a functional AI agent end-to-end (this project) and production automation workflows
- Has a clear philosophy on AI and content: AI scales content, it doesn't create thought leadership. Tried Jasper, rejected it — prefers human insight + AI repurposing
- Focuses on high-leverage AI use cases: enrichment, automation, personalization, and decision speed — not just content generation
- Uses Gong conversation data to close the loop between what marketing assumes and what buyers actually say
- Evaluates tools rigorously — has replaced ZoomInfo with Apollo, Make.com with N8N, and 6sense/Demandbase thinking with HockeyStack
- Career-long pattern of early technical adoption (Java, open-source, time-series, MQTT) → AI-native marketing is the natural next step
