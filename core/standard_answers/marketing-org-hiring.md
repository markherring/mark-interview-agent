# Marketing Organization Structure and Hiring Priorities

## Question Type
- "How would you structure the marketing organization?"
- "What are your first hiring priorities?"
- "What roles would you hire first?"

## Mark's Answer

Before hiring anyone, get positioning and messaging locked in the first 90 days. If you haven't defined who you are and who the ICP is, you don't want anyone talking about anything yet.

**1. Demand gen first.** The engine that builds pipeline — inbound, outbound, ABM, SDR management, handoffs. Without pipeline, nothing else matters.

**2. Content orchestration second.** Not a team of writers. Someone who gets engineers, product people, and customers to create authentic technical content. Technical buyers smell fake expertise immediately. Marketing coaches and orchestrates, not writes.

**3. Product marketing third.** I can hold this initially since it's close to my background, but eventually you need someone translating technical capabilities into vertical use cases and sales-ready messaging.

## What I Don't Hire Early

- Content writers (get SMEs to write)
- Big PR agencies (fractional until model is proven)
- Lots of specialists (3-4 excellent people over 8 spread thin)

## What I Personally Own

- Positioning and messaging (never delegate)
- Pipeline orchestration and revenue connection
- Technical translation and GTM strategy
