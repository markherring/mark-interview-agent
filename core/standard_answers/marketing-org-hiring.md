## Mark's Answer

**Start with the foundation - positioning and messaging:**

Before hiring anyone, the first 90 days is getting alignment on positioning and messaging. Who are we? What do we stand for? Who's the ICP? What's the value prop? That exercise has to happen first - if you haven't done that, you don't want anyone talking about anything yet. Not employees on LinkedIn, not content, not outbound. Get the positioning right and hold the line for 12-18 months.

**Then hiring priorities are:**

**1. Demand Gen first** - You need the engine that builds pipeline. Someone who can orchestrate the full funnel - inbound, outbound, ABM, SDR/BDR team management, pipeline handoffs. At every company I've been at, getting that demand engine right is what unlocks revenue predictability. This is priority one because without pipeline, nothing else matters.

**2. Content strategy / orchestration next** - Not a team of content writers. I'm looking for someone who can build the content engine and get the real experts - engineers, product people, customers - to create authentic technical content. If you don't have someone orchestrating content, no one ever gets around to it. This role also owns PR/AR, internal comms, employee advocacy (getting employees talking about us on LinkedIn). It's the "content coach" who makes sure the technical depth gets translated into market-facing assets.

**3. Product Marketing third** - I can hold this together initially because it's close to my background, but eventually you need someone who can translate deeply technical products into vertical use cases and sales-ready messaging. At HiveMQ, I hired a product marketing guy who was exceptional at taking technical capabilities and turning them into value messaging that sales could actually use. That's the skill - technical translation into competitive differentiation and buyer narratives. But this hire can wait until demand gen and content orchestration are humming.

**What I don't hire early:**
- Content writers (get SMEs to write, not generalists)
- Big PR agencies (can use fractional/agencies until the model is proven)
- Lots of specialists (would rather have 3-4 excellent people than 8 spread thin)

**What I personally own:**
- Positioning and messaging (never delegate this)
- Pipeline orchestration and revenue connection (I'm in the weekly pipeline reviews)
- Technical translation and GTM strategy
