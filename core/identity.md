## Technical Strengths

Career-long pattern of marketing very technical products to very technical audiences.

- **AI-era marketing operator:** Hands-on with the modern AI marketing stack — Clay for data enrichment and prospecting, N8N for workflow automation, Claude and ChatGPT for content and analysis, Tofu AI for content personalization, plus broader agentic tooling for lifecycle orchestration, targeting, and GTM execution. Actively replacing legacy workflows with AI-powered automation across the full marketing stack — not just experimenting, but operating.

## Professional Background
Senior B2B marketing executive with 7+ years as CMO at venture-backed startups (Series A through E) and 10+ years in SVP/VP marketing roles at enterprise platform companies. Career spans Oracle, Sun Microsystems ($1B Java platform), Software AG ($300M+ portfolio), Hortonworks, InfluxData, Teleport, Pachyderm (acquired by HPE), Twingate, and HiveMQ.

Track record of building and scaling GTM engines across PLG and enterprise-led motions for complex, developer-focused, data, and infrastructure platforms. Proven ability to translate deep technical adoption into forecastable pipeline and revenue — from $1M to $30M ARR at InfluxData, $10M to $30M at HiveMQ, and $20M to $120M at Forte Software. Built marketing teams from scratch (3 to 30-person orgs), scaled SDR organizations, and operated as a hands-on leader who drives execution alongside strategy.

Education: Bachelor of Science, Mathematics — University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa.

## Core Values & Working Style
- **Operationally rigorous:** Treats marketing as a revenue system — pipeline, coverage ratios, forecast confidence, attribution. If it can't be measured, it gets fixed until it can.
- **Direct and human-first:** Leads with candor but always considers the human side. Challenges assumptions constructively. Won't sugarcoat, but won't be careless either.
- **Pragmatic builder:** Values simplicity and getting things done over over-engineering. Prefers flexible, scalable solutions that can be spun up quickly and iterated.
- **Scrappy and hands-on:** Gets into the details — writes copy, builds campaigns, debugs funnels. Not a "strategy deck" CMO. Rolls up sleeves and drives.
- **Analytically grounded:** Makes decisions with data, not intuition alone. Integrates BI and marketing ops early to improve forecasting and attribution.
- **Collaborative but decisive:** Gets the right people aligned on strategy, then executes relentlessly. Believes in committing to clear positioning and not hedging.

## Communication Style
- Direct and candid — says what needs to be said without being abrasive
- Grounds arguments in real examples and actual results, not theory
- Thinks in systems — connects positioning to pipeline to revenue naturally
- Balances empathy with accountability (leads with the human side, then gets to the business reality)
- Writes clearly and concisely — no jargon inflation, no fluff
- Not afraid to challenge assumptions or suggest bold changes

## What Excites You About Work
- **Driving the full marketing stack and creating real business results.** Not interested in just one slice — wants to own the whole engine from brand to pipeline to revenue.
- **The craft of audience understanding.** Figuring out who the buyers are, what they care about, how to reach them — then translating that into messages, content, and programs that actually land. Balancing technical content for the champion with value-selling for the economic buyer.
- **Getting hands dirty in a technical world.** Building a marketing-driven organization inside companies where the product is deeply technical. Making marketing credible and respected by engineering, product, and sales — not just tolerated.
- **Building teams and making an organization known for knowing how to do marketing.** Wants the company and the market to recognize that this team operates at a high level.
- **The whole system working together** — website, documentation, events, content, outbound, PLG — all connected and driving toward pipeline.

## Career Goals
- **Role:** CMO at a growing startup, Series B+ preferred. Open to later-stage companies that need a seasoned GTM operator to scale.
- **Product:** Strong technical, data, or AI-driven product. Developer-focused or infrastructure-oriented businesses where technical fluency matters.
- **What matters most:** Being part of a vibrant, growing organization where the work makes a visible difference. Building a highly functional marketing organization that earns recognition — internally and in the market.
- **Team size:** Not a primary motivator. Has built from 3 to 30-person orgs and is comfortable at any stage. Cares more about building capability than headcount.
- **Budget:** Needs enough to execute, but not motivated by big budgets for their own sake. Motivated by building something that works.
- **Location:** Remote-first preferred. Open to commuting into San Francisco. Not interested in heavy commute obligations beyond that.
- **Style:** Hands-on operator with a strong analytical and execution mindset. Not looking for a "figurehead CMO" role — wants to build and drive.
