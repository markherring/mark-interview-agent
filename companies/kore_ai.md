## Core Product: XO Platform
Low-code platform for AI agent development with two paradigms:
- **Dialog Agents (Orchestrated Autonomy):** Powered by DialogGPT and Agent Node. Structured flow approach with dynamic conversational experience. Handles multi-turn interactions, intent recognition, autonomous info extraction. Somewhat deterministic but adapts to input variations.
- **AI Agents (Full Autonomy):** Full autonomy with deep contextual understanding. Goal-oriented, stateful, with planning capability. Reasoning capabilities and fluid, human-like interactions.

### Technical Architecture (Three-Tier Agentic)
1. **Foundation Tier** — Memory and knowledge management
2. **Workflow Tier** — Turns understanding into structured plans
3. **Autonomous Tier** — Executes plans while feeding new insights back into memory

**Agent Loop:** Perception → Reasoning → Planning → Action → Verification → Learning

### Key Capabilities
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration & Routing** — Single unified interface, DialogGPT-powered context-aware routing
- **Search AI (Agentic RAG)** — Autonomous agent capabilities combined with RAG; breaks down complex queries, retrieves from specific sources, generates contextual answers
- **Memory & Context** — Short-term (conversation context) + long-term (user preferences, interaction history) memory management
- **100+ pre-built enterprise integrations** (Salesforce, SAP, Epic, etc.) + visual tools for custom integrations
- **Developer Tools:** Model Hub (connect AI models), Prompt Studio (optimize prompts), Evaluation Studio (real-time performance)
- **Multi-channel:** 30+ digital channels, Voice Gateways, third-party IVR
- **Enterprise guardrails:** HIPAA, GDPR, financial services compliance, access controls, audit trails, data leakage prevention

## Analyst Recognition (Massively Under-Leveraged — Key Opportunity)
- **Gartner MQ Leader** — Conversational AI Platforms (2022, 2023, 2025) — highest "Ability to Execute" in 2025
- **Forrester Wave Leader** — Conversational AI for Customer Service (Q2 2024) — highest "Current Offering" score
- **Forrester Wave Leader** — Cognitive Search Platforms (Q4 2025) — highest score across 11 of 21 criteria, #1 in strategy
- **Gartner EMQ Leader** — Generative AI Engineering and Productivity Tools
- Leader in Everest PEAK Matrix, IDC MarketScape, ISG Provider Lens, Aragon Research Globe, G2 Crowd

## Competitive Landscape
- **Direct:** Sierra ($350M Series B, Brett Taylor), Yellow.ai, Cognigy (now NiCE), PolyAI, Decagon, Ada
- **Platform threat:** ServiceNow (acquired Moveworks), Salesforce (Agentforce), Microsoft, Amazon Lex, Google Dialogflow
- **Kore.ai differentiator:** Open platform (LLM-agnostic), enterprise-grade governance, full lifecycle (build → deploy → orchestrate), vertical depth

## Role Target: Chief Marketing Officer


### Interview Log
- 2026-01-03 - Spoke with Trang Watson - Chief of staff she introed me. We worked together at HiveMQ
- 2026-01-21 — Intro: Mark Herring ↔ Uma Sandilya
- 2026-01-26 — Bill Macaitis & Mark
- 2026-01-29 — Lynda Smith & Mark

### Office
Mark is Bay Area-based and comfortable committing to 2x/week in the San Mateo office. Open to discussing cadence as the role evolves.

### Top Problems to Solve
1. **Brand & Awareness** — Zero Bay Area visibility. Orlando HQ + east coast investors = no tech ecosystem presence. Need analyst-led credibility, not hype.
2. **Pipeline Conversion** — Not purely a TOFU problem. Breakdown at MDR/handoff layer. Leads sitting untouched.
3. **Messaging Discipline** — Homepage changes with "wind and whim." Over-broad narrative ("we do everything"). Gartner leadership buried. Need to define who Kore is and hold for a year.
4. **Execution Consistency** — Stop restarting narrative every few months. Focus, hold the line.
5. **ABM Muscle** — Currently opportunistic. Need disciplined, hyper-targeted ABM motion for P1–P4 accounts.

### What They Need in a CMO
- Scrappy operator who can work with lean budgets (~$6M program budget is below industry benchmark for $100M+ ARR, but Mark has operated effectively in this range)
- Messaging discipline and clarity-first approach
- Customer-centric, trust-based marketing (not flashy enterprise event spam)
- Comfortable fixing adjacent problems (BDR, enablement, execution)
- Can educate and partner with a strong CEO personality
- Executive alignment across sales, product, board
- Bay Area credibility and network

### What's NOT Broken
- Product quality and scale
- Customer traction and enterprise proof points
- Leadership openness to change
- Analyst recognition (massively under-leveraged)

## Why Mark is Excited
- **Deeply technical platform at enterprise scale** — Not a chatbot wrapper. Real agentic architecture, multi-agent orchestration, enterprise-grade governance. This is a serious product with serious customers (CVS 800M interactions/yr, Citibank 400M interactions/yr).
- **Agentic AI is the next platform shift** — Kore.ai is positioned at the center of where enterprise AI is heading. The category is forming right now and this company has the product, the customers, and the analyst validation to win it.
- **The marketing problem is solvable and familiar** — Messaging discipline, pipeline conversion, ABM, leveraging analyst credibility, translating a complex platform into clear vertical GTM. This is exactly what Mark has done at InfluxData, Teleport, HiveMQ, and Pachyderm.
- **Under-leveraged analyst recognition** — Gartner MQ Leader three times, Forrester Wave Leader multiple times, and none of it is visible in the market. That's a massive unlock waiting to happen.
- **Scrappy, execution-focused environment** — Mark knows how to make lean budgets work through precision: ABM over spray-and-pray, analyst leverage over event bloat, customer marketing over flashy campaigns.
- **Strong advisory bench** — Bill Macaitis (Slack, Zendesk CMO) wants to partner. Lynda Smith has been holding things together and wants a real CMO to take over. The support structure is there.

## Key Talking Points
- "The analyst recognition is extraordinary — Gartner Leader three times, Forrester Leader multiple times — and it's completely buried. That's the first thing I'd surface and anchor all positioning around."
- "I've spent my career taking complex, deeply technical platforms and turning them into clear positioning and predictable pipeline. That's exactly what Kore.ai needs right now."
- "Messaging discipline means picking a lane and holding it for a year, not changing the homepage every quarter. I've done this at InfluxData, Teleport, and HiveMQ — define who you are, hold the line, let the market catch up."
- "Pipeline conversion breakdowns at the MDR/handoff layer are fixable. I've rebuilt SDR/BDR orgs and pipeline handoff processes at Teleport and InfluxData — this is operational, not strategic."
- "$6M means precision — ABM into P1-P4 accounts, analyst-led credibility, customer marketing. I know how to make lean budgets work, and I know when they need to scale."
- "The agentic AI category is forming right now. Kore.ai has the product depth and enterprise proof points to own it — but only if marketing tells that story clearly and consistently."
