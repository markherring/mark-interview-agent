# Descript - Company Context

## ⚠️ EXAMPLE RULES FOR DESCRIPT
- **DO NOT quote HiveMQ PLG numbers** ($2.6M→$8.4M) — Descript is at $70M ARR, those numbers sound small
- **USE InfluxData** ($1M→$30M ARR) as the primary "built from scratch" reference
- **USE pipeline scaling examples** (InfluxData $5.5M→$9M/quarter, Teleport $3.1M→$8.4M/quarter) for sales-led motion
- **HiveMQ is OK for:** ABM strategy, vertical focus, pipeline doubling ($25M→$53M) — just not the PLG dollar figures

## Core Product/Technology

**Product:** Descript — AI-powered video/audio editing platform

**Core innovation:** Edit video by editing a transcript. Delete words → cuts scenes automatically. Type text → adds AI narration. Edit like a document, not a timeline.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Text-based video/audio editing** — Edit transcript, media follows. Genuinely differentiated workflow.
- **Underlord AI Co-Editor (Jul 2025)** — Natural language editing commands ("make this ready for YouTube"). AI agent paradigm applied to creative tools.
- **Overdub (Voice Cloning)** — Now powered by ElevenLabs v3. 200+ voices, 30+ languages. Type text → generates audio in your voice.
- **AI Creator Tools** — Eye contact correction, AI green screen, automatic multicam, Studio Sound (noise reduction/enhancement), filler word removal, retake detection.
- **Descript Rooms** — Browser-based 4K multitrack recording (up to 10 participants). Came via SquadCast acquisition.
- **AI clip creation** — Automated social media clip generation from longer content.
- **Auto-captioning, translation (20+ languages), dubbing**
- **Enterprise features** — Brand kits, collaboration, admin tools, SSO, SOC 2 Type II, dedicated support, unlimited basic seats.
- **API** — Launching in ~3 months. Enterprise-only, bulk/batch editing. Potential unlock for enterprise adoption.

**Descript's moat:** Text-based editing paradigm + Overdub voice cloning + Underlord AI agent + OpenAI partnership. The "edit like a doc" workflow is genuinely differentiated. Vertical integration from capture → edit → publish.

**Risk:** Consumer-creator tools market is crowded and commoditizing fast with AI. The enterprise pivot is the growth bet.

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Strength | vs Descript |
|---|---|---|
| **Riverside.fm** | Studio-quality recording, 4K | Better recording, weaker editing |
| **Captions** | Mobile-first, social clips | More consumer, less enterprise |
| **Canva** | Design + video | Better visual design, weaker editing depth |
| **Adobe Premiere** | Pro editing | Traditional timeline, steeper learning curve |
| **Synthesia** | AI avatar video generation | Different use case (no human recording) |
| **Otter.ai** | Meeting transcription | Meeting-focused, not editing |
| **DaVinci Resolve** | Pro-grade editing (free) | More powerful but far more complex |

**Descript's differentiator:** Open question — "edit like a doc" is genuinely unique, but enterprise buyers need more than a clever paradigm. The moat is the vertical integration from capture → edit → publish, combined with AI features that deliver real productivity gains (not hype). The enterprise bet depends on proving this to marketing, L&D, and sales enablement teams at scale.

## Role Target



### Interview Log
- 2026-01-27 — Laura Burkhauser (CEO) — Strong meeting Clear next step toward 60–90 day plan with NDA financial access.
- 2026-02-14 — Will Paulus (Sales leader) — Scheduled

### Problems to Solve
1. **Zero B2B marketing infrastructure** — No historical B2B SaaS marketing leadership. Organization and product DNA is heavily consumer. No playbook, no outbound, no repeatable demand engine.
2. **Pipeline depends on hand-raisers and PQLs** — Enterprise pipeline today is entirely inbound. No proven outbound or ABM motion. No pipeline predictability.
3. **ICP discipline** — Need to define who the enterprise buyer actually is. Which verticals, which personas, which use cases close best and retain best.
4. **Consumer churn (~80%)** — PLG funnel is leaky on the consumer side. Enterprise bet needs to work for sustainable growth.
5. **Preserve PLG while scaling enterprise** — Can't break what's working on the PLG side while building the sales-led motion. Hybrid GTM required.
6. **Build and reshape the marketing team** — Current team is consumer-oriented. Need B2B muscle — demand gen, product marketing, sales enablement, ops.

### What They Need in This Role
- Blank-sheet builder — no existing B2B playbook to inherit
- ICP and segmentation discipline
- Repeatable pipeline engine builder who works tightly with sales
- Fast experimentation mindset — test channels, measure, double down or kill
- Hit concrete pipeline goals — this is a results role
- Product-savvy thought partner to a product-first CEO
- Someone who can build and reshape a marketing team quickly
- Comfortable with PLG + enterprise hybrid motions

### What's NOT Broken
- Product quality and AI features (Underlord, Overdub, Studio Sound)
- PLG adoption and brand with creators (6M+ users)
- Enterprise customer proof points (Salesforce, NYT, BBC, Amazon, Netflix, Apple)
- Revenue growth (~75% YoY, ~$70M ARR)
- NRR (130%) and enterprise momentum (sales revenue tripled QoQ)
- CEO quality — Laura is sharp, product-obsessed, and building her own team

## Why Mark is Excited

- **Building B2B from scratch inside a product-led company is exactly what I've done before.** InfluxData was the same pattern — massive developer/user adoption, no enterprise GTM engine. I built it from zero to $30M ARR. HiveMQ was similar — strong product, emerging PLG, enterprise motion needed focus and discipline. This is the build I know how to do.
- **The PLG + enterprise hybrid is my sweet spot.** I've built this motion at InfluxData (PLG funnel → $5M PLG ARR + enterprise sales engine) and HiveMQ (cloud signups +68%, PLG revenue $2.6M→$8.4M alongside enterprise GTM). Knowing how to scale enterprise without breaking PLG is a specific skill, and it's exactly what Descript needs.
- **The product is genuinely differentiated and the AI features are real, not hype.** Edit-like-a-doc is a legitimately new paradigm. Underlord, Overdub, Studio Sound — these are practical AI features that deliver immediate value. This isn't an AI wrapper, it's a real product with real engineering depth. That makes the marketing job more interesting and more credible.
- **Understanding the market and the buyer is the interesting challenge.** I wasn't an MQTT expert before HiveMQ. I wasn't a time-series database expert before InfluxData. I wasn't a Zero Trust security expert before Teleport. In every case, I learned the market, learned the buyer, and built the GTM around who actually cares and why. The question here isn't whether I know video editing — it's whether I can figure out why Apple buys this when there are dozens of video editing tools. That's the interesting problem.
- **Laura is a strong product-first CEO to partner with.** Product-obsessed, builder-oriented, new in the CEO seat and assembling her team. That's the best time to come in — you can shape the GTM from the ground up with a CEO who understands product deeply but needs a marketing partner who understands pipeline and revenue.

## Mark's Positioning / Fit

**Strong fit signals:**
- Built PLG + enterprise hybrid motions (InfluxData, HiveMQ) ✔
- Translated developer/technical adoption into enterprise pipeline ✔
- Built demand gen from scratch at multiple companies ✔
- ICP discipline and segmentation experience ✔
- Comfortable in blank-sheet, build-from-zero roles ✔
- Product-savvy, technical marketing leader ✔

**Potential concerns to address:**
- Background is more technical infrastructure — Descript is creative tools. **Not worried.** Same pattern as HiveMQ (never used MQTT before), InfluxData (never worked with time-series databases), Teleport (never worked in Zero Trust). The skill is learning the market and the buyer, not being a domain expert on day one.
- Company DNA is very consumer — my experience is enterprise-first. **But that's exactly the point** — they need someone who brings enterprise GTM expertise into a consumer-DNA company.

## Key Talking Points

- "I've built this exact motion before — taking a product-led company with massive adoption and building the enterprise GTM engine from zero. At InfluxData we went from $1M to $30M ARR doing exactly this. At HiveMQ we more than doubled qualified pipeline while scaling PLG revenue alongside enterprise."
- "The first thing I'd do is figure out why enterprises buy Descript. Not why creators love it — that's clear. Why does Apple buy it? Why does Salesforce buy it? What's the enterprise ICP, and what's the use case that sticks? That analysis drives everything else."
- "PLG and enterprise are not enemies — they're two parts of the same engine. The PLG funnel generates awareness, adoption, and PQLs. The enterprise motion converts the best of those into larger, stickier deals. I've built that bridge at InfluxData and HiveMQ, and I know how to do it without breaking what's working on the PLG side."
- "With a sales team that went from 1 to 5 AEs and tripled revenue QoQ, you're at the inflection point where marketing needs to shift from supporting hand-raisers to building a repeatable pipeline engine. That's outbound, ABM, content that maps to the enterprise buying cycle, and enablement that helps AEs close faster."
- "I'm not a video editing expert, and that's fine. I wasn't an MQTT expert before HiveMQ, and I wasn't a time-series database expert before InfluxData. The skill is learning the market, learning the buyer, and building the GTM around what actually drives pipeline and revenue. I've done that across six different technical domains."
- "130% NRR is a strong signal that the product delivers value after the sale. The enterprise marketing challenge is getting more logos in the door — and once they're in, the product does the expansion work. That's the best kind of enterprise GTM problem to have."
